```typescript
{
  id: number;

  status: 'AVAILABLE' | 'RENTED' | 'MAINTENANCE';
  category: string;
  description: string;
  serialNumber: string;
  location: string;
  dailyRate: number;
  orderItems: Array<{
    order: {
      customer: {
        name: string;
        email: string;
        phone: string;
      }
    }
  }>;
}
```
