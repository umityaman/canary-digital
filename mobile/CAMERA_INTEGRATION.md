## 🤝 Integration Points

### Inspection System
```typescript
// Link photos to inspection
{
  inspectionId: number,
  type: 'pickup' | 'return' | 'damage' | 'inspection'
}
```

### Equipment System
```typescript
// Link photos to equipment (without inspection)
{
  equipmentId: number,
  type: 'inspection'
}
```

### Order System
```typescript
// Link photos to order
{
  orderId: number,
  type: 'pickup' | 'return'
}
```

## 🚨 Known Limitations

1. **Web Not Supported** - Camera only works on iOS/Android
2. **No Offline Mode** - Photos must upload immediately
3. **Sequential Upload** - One photo at a time (slower but stable)
4. **No Local Storage** - Photos lost if user navigates back before upload
5. **Max 10 Photos** - Hard limit per inspection
6. **No Video** - Only still images supported

## 📞 Support

### Common Issues

**Issue: Camera permission denied**
```
Solution: Go to device Settings → Apps → Canary → Permissions → Camera → Allow
```

**Issue: Photos not uploading**
```
Check: Network connectivity, backend URL, authentication token
Retry: Use "Tekrar Dene" button in partial upload alert
```

**Issue: Upload too slow**
```
Cause: Large photos (3-5MB) + slow network
Solution: Images auto-optimized to ~500KB, but 4G recommended
```

**Issue: File too large error**
```
Cause: Optimization failed or corrupt image
Solution: Delete photo, retake with lower resolution
```
