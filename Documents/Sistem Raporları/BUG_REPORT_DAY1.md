## 🔴 BUG #1: Dashboard Stats API Error

**Severity:** 🔴 HIGH  
**Status:** 🆕 NEW  
**Category:** Backend API  
**Module:** Dashboard

### Description
Dashboard stats endpoint returns 500 error with message "Company ID not found"

### Endpoint
`GET /api/dashboard/stats`

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Login with admin@canary.com / admin123
2. Get valid JWT token
3. Call GET /api/dashboard/stats with Authorization header
4. Observe 500 error

### Expected Behavior
- Return 200 OK
- Return dashboard statistics (total revenue, orders, equipment, customers)

### Actual Behavior
- Returns 500 Internal Server Error
- Error message: `{"error":"Company ID not found"}`

### Technical Details
**Request:**
```http
GET /api/dashboard/stats HTTP/1.1
Host: canary-backend-672344972017.europe-west1.run.app
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Company ID not found"
}
```

**Status Code:** 500

### Root Cause (Hypothesis)
The middleware or route handler is not correctly extracting companyId from the JWT token or user session.

### Suggested Fix
1. Check `backend/src/routes/dashboard.ts`
2. Verify JWT token contains `companyId`
3. Check middleware that sets `req.user` or `req.companyId`
4. Add proper error handling for missing companyId

### Impact
- Dashboard page cannot load statistics
- Users cannot see KPI widgets
- Affects user experience on main page

### Priority Justification
**HIGH** because:
- Dashboard is the main landing page after login
- Users immediately see error
- Affects first impression of the application

### Workaround
None available - users cannot view dashboard statistics

### Related Issues
None

### Files to Check
- `backend/src/routes/dashboard.ts`
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`
- JWT token generation in `backend/src/routes/auth.ts`

### Browser/Environment
- Production backend
- All browsers affected
- Mobile & desktop affected

### Screenshots
N/A (API error)

## ✅ WORKING FEATURES (For Reference)

These work correctly:
- ✅ Health check
- ✅ User login
- ✅ Equipment list
- ✅ Customer list
- ✅ JWT token generation
- ✅ Authentication middleware

## 🔴 BUG #2: Error Toast Disappears Too Quickly

**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Status:** 🆕 NEW  
**Category:** Frontend UX  
**Module:** Authentication

### Description
When user enters wrong password, error message appears but disappears too quickly (less than 2 seconds), making it hard to read.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to login page
2. Enter email: admin@canary.com
3. Enter wrong password: wrong123
4. Click login
5. Error message appears and disappears in ~1 second

### Expected Behavior
Error message should stay visible for at least 3-5 seconds or require manual dismissal.

### Actual Behavior
Error toast disappears in ~1 second, too fast to read properly.

### Suggested Fix
Increase toast duration in toast configuration:
- File: `frontend/src/components/ui/use-toast.ts` or toast provider
- Change duration from 1000ms to 4000ms for error messages

### Impact
- Users might not see error messages
- Poor user experience
- Users might not understand why login failed

### Priority: MEDIUM
Not critical but affects UX negatively.

## 🟡 BUG #3: Remember Me Feature Missing

**Severity:** 🟢 LOW  
**Status:** 🆕 NEW  
**Category:** Frontend Feature  
**Module:** Authentication

### Description
Login form doesn't have a "Remember Me" checkbox option.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to login page
2. Look for "Remember Me" checkbox
3. Feature is missing

### Expected Behavior
Should have a "Remember Me" checkbox that:
- Saves user credentials (email only, not password)
- Uses longer-lived refresh token
- Persists login session across browser closes

### Actual Behavior
No remember me option exists.

### Suggested Implementation
1. Add checkbox to login form
2. Store preference in localStorage
3. Use longer-lived refresh token (30 days vs 7 days)
4. Auto-fill email on return

### Impact
- Users must login every time
- Reduces convenience
- Lower engagement

### Priority: LOW
Enhancement rather than bug. Can be added in future sprint.

## 🔴 BUG #4: Equipment Price Input - Leading Zero Issue

**Severity:** 🔴 HIGH  
**Status:** 🆕 NEW  
**Category:** Frontend Form  
**Module:** Equipment Management

### Description
In "Add Equipment" form, when entering price (e.g., 0500), the leading zero doesn't clear automatically. When trying to save, validation error occurs.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to Equipment page
2. Click "Add Equipment"
3. Fill in all required fields
4. In "Daily Price" field, type: 0500
5. Try to save
6. Observe error: "Invalid price format" or similar

### Expected Behavior
- Leading zeros should be automatically removed (0500 → 500)
- Or input should prevent leading zeros
- Form should accept numeric input properly
- Save should succeed with valid price

### Actual Behavior
- Leading zero stays in input
- Validation fails on save
- Equipment cannot be created

### Technical Details
**Possible Causes:**
1. Input type might be "text" instead of "number"
2. Validation regex doesn't handle leading zeros
3. Backend expects integer but receives string with leading zero

**Suggested Fixes:**
```typescript
// Option 1: Auto-remove leading zeros
onChange={(e) => {
  const value = e.target.value.replace(/^0+/, '') || '0';
  setDailyPrice(value);
}}

// Option 2: Use number input with proper validation
<input 
  type="number" 
  min="0" 
  step="0.01"
  onChange={(e) => setDailyPrice(parseFloat(e.target.value))}
/>

// Option 3: Parse before submit
const submitData = {
  ...formData,
  dailyPrice: parseInt(formData.dailyPrice, 10)
};
```

### Files to Check
- `frontend/src/pages/Equipment.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/EquipmentForm.tsx`
- Form validation logic

### Impact
- **HIGH** - Users cannot add new equipment
- Blocks core business functionality
- Affects inventory management

### Priority: HIGH
Should be fixed immediately as it blocks equipment creation.
