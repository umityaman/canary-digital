## üö® Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted"

**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ 2-Step Verification enabled?
- ‚úÖ Using App Password (not regular password)?
- ‚úÖ Copied password correctly (remove spaces)?

### Problem: "Less secure app access"

**Solution:**
Gmail App Passwords work regardless of "less secure app" setting. Use App Password, not regular password.

### Problem: "Daily sending limit exceeded"

**Solution:**
Gmail free accounts have sending limits:
- New accounts: ~100 emails/day
- Established accounts: ~500 emails/day
- Consider upgrading to Google Workspace for higher limits

### Problem: Emails going to spam

**Solution:**
- Add your domain to SPF records
- Set up DKIM
- Consider using a custom domain email
- For production, consider Postmark, SendGrid, or AWS SES
